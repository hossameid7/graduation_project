# System Implementation

This section details the technical implementation of the Power Transformer Monitoring system, covering both the backend and frontend components.

## 1. Backend (Django)

The backend is developed using the Django framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the system's core logic and data management.

### 1.1 Authentication & Authorization

User authentication and authorization are handled to ensure secure access to the system. This likely involves:
*   User registration and login functionality.
*   Session management or token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to maintain user sessions.
*   Permission controls to differentiate access levels (e.g., regular users vs. administrators).
*   Secure password handling (hashing and salting).

*(Further details on specific Django packages used, like django-rest-framework's authentication classes or django-allauth, would be beneficial here.)*

### 1.2 Transformers API

A RESTful API is implemented to manage transformer data. Key aspects include:
*   Endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on transformer records.
*   Endpoints to retrieve transformer status, measurements, and historical data.
*   Data serialization to convert database models into JSON format for frontend consumption, likely using Django REST Framework serializers.
*   API versioning (if applicable) to manage changes over time.

*(Details on the specific models, serializers, and viewsets/APIViews used in the BACK-END/power_analysis/api/ directory would enhance this section.)*

### 1.3 AI Chat for Asking About Transformers

An integrated AI chat feature allows users to inquire about transformer status and data using natural language. This implementation likely involves:
*   An API endpoint to receive user queries.
*   Integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) or a custom AI model.
*   Processing user queries to understand intent and extract relevant information (e.g., transformer ID).
*   Retrieving data from the database based on the query.
*   Formatting the response from the AI model for display to the user.

*(Specifics about the AI model/service used, the prompt engineering techniques, and the data retrieval logic are needed for a complete description.)*

### 1.4 Notification System and Chat with Admin

The system includes features for notifications and direct communication with administrators:
*   **Notifications:** Mechanisms to alert users or administrators about critical events (e.g., transformer faults, maintenance schedules). This could involve email notifications (as configured via .env), in-app alerts, or potentially other channels.
*   **Admin Chat:** A feature allowing users to communicate directly with system administrators, possibly implemented using WebSockets for real-time interaction or a simpler request/response model.

*(Details on the notification triggers, delivery methods, and the chat implementation technology (e.g., Django Channels) would be valuable.)*

## 2. Frontend (React)

The frontend is built using the React library, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface for monitoring and managing transformers.

### 2.1 Logging & Sign Up

User interface components are provided for user account management:
*   A login form to authenticate users.
*   A sign-up form for new user registration.
*   Integration with the backend authentication API endpoints.
*   State management (e.g., using Context API, Redux, or Zustand) to handle user authentication status across the application.

*(Mentioning specific UI libraries used, like Material UI or Bootstrap, would add detail.)*

### 2.2 Dashboard Design

A central dashboard presents key information and visualizations to the user:
*   Overview of transformer statuses.
*   Key performance indicators (KPIs).
*   Navigation to different sections of the application.
*   Responsive design to ensure usability across different screen sizes.

*(Screenshots or descriptions of specific dashboard widgets and layouts would be helpful.)*

### 2.3 Translation into (AR, RU, EN)

The user interface supports multiple languages (Arabic, Russian, English):
*   Implementation of an internationalization (i18n) library (e.g., react-i18next, FormatJS).
*   Language files containing translations for UI text elements.
*   A mechanism for users to switch between supported languages.

*(Details on the specific i18n library and how language switching is handled would complete this part.)*

### 2.4 Plotting the Measurements, FDD, RUL

Visualizations are used to display transformer data effectively:
*   Graphs and charts showing real-time and historical measurements (e.g., temperature, load, voltage).
*   Visualization of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) results.
*   Display of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions.
*   Integration of a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, Plotly.js) to render the plots.
*   Fetching data from the relevant backend API endpoints for visualization.

*(Mentioning the specific plotting library and types of charts used would be beneficial.)*
